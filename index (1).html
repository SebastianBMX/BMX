<p> BMX was first introduced in the 70s, when young children began to modify their bikes on dirt tracks, inspired by the motocross superstars of the time. BMX racing was a phenomenon by the mid-1970s. Children were racing standard road bikes off-road, around purpose-built tracks in California.
After some time, bike companies began to manufacture cheap, lightweight bmx bikes for the public. The first company to do this was founded by the person who first popularized the sport of BMX Freestyle, Bob Haro, founder of the Mountain and BMX bicycle manufacturer company Haro Bikes.  
The popularity of those early BMX bikes exploded with the release of the 1972 motorcycle racing documentary "On Any Sunday", which inspired youth across entire United States to start building their own version of light off-road bicycles. Not long after, bicycle manufactures jumped to the occasion to offer new BMX models that soon became driving force of official bicycle motocross sport. Many organizations were also formed to regulate the sport of bicycle motocross, starting with the National Bicycle League that was established in 1974 and many other that were formed later (National Bicycle Association, American Bicycle Association, International BMX Federation, Union Cyclist International).
